    Wordpress page templete:
    
    When a person browses to your website, WordPress selects which template to use for rendering that page. 
    
    i.e. WordPress looks for template files in the following order:

    1) Page Template — If the page has a custom template assigned, WordPress looks for that file and, if found, uses it.
    
    2) page-{slug}.php — If no custom template has been assigned, WordPress looks for and uses a specialized template that 
    contains the page’s slug.
    
    3) page-{id}.php — If a specialized template that includes the page’s slug is not found, WordPress looks for and uses 
    a specialized template named with the page’s ID.
    
    4) page.php — If a specialized template that includes the page’s ID is not found, WordPress looks for and uses the 
    theme’s default page template.
    
    5) index.php — If no specific page templates are assigned or found, WordPress defaults back to using the theme’s index 
    file to render pages.
